        Hello! I'm Frank. I'm a senior at RIT studying computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always learning. I chose to study the field of computer science not only because I love the work, but because I don't want to ever stop learning. From an internship, I'd like to gain the skills needed to grow as a developer and a professional, while building a strong foundation of industry standards.   
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal as a developer is to innovate and elevate outdated or complicated procedures. I'd like my work to make someone else's life a little easier. I love Lob's connection with the "offline" world, and believe that services that can be experienced in a physical sense have the largest impact on customers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to speaking with you!
      </p>
